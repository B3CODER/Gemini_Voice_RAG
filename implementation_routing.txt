Modular Routing System - Implementation Plan
Create a clean, organized routing system with three routing components in a structured folder hierarchy.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

Folder Structure: Creating routing_system folder with:

handlers/ - Core routing logic (master_router, navigation, medical, general_tools)
tools/
 - Tool declarations for voice agent
config/ - Configuration files (workflow configs, site lists)
main.py - Entry point for the voice agent
Three Routing Components:

Navigation: Page/website navigation (Google, Gemini, settings, etc.)
Medical Extraction: Clinical query extraction (organ, site, procedure, test)
General Tools: API tools (weather, news, crypto, jokes, etc.)

Core Components
[NEW] 
routing_system/handlers/master_router.py
Unified router that classifies query intent
Routes to: navigation, medical, or general tools
Returns structured responses
[NEW] 
routing_system/handlers/navigation.py
Moved from root navigation.py
Handles page/website navigation
[NEW] 
routing_system/handlers/medical_extraction.py
Moved from root medical_extraction.py
Extracts medical information from queries
[NEW] 
routing_system/handlers/general_tools.py
Extracted from final_tool.py
Handles weather, news, crypto, jokes, quotes, etc.
[NEW] 
routing_system/tools/tool_declarations.py
Centralizes all tool declarations
Provides unified interface for voice agent
[NEW] 
routing_system/config/medical_sites.py
Valid GIT sites configuration
Separated from medical_extraction logic
[NEW] 
routing_system/config/workflow_config.py
General tools workflow configuration
API endpoints, prompt templates
[NEW] 
routing_system/main.py
Voice agent with all three routing components
Updated from final.py
[NEW] 
routing_system/README.md
Usage documentation
Architecture overview
Examples
Verification Plan
Automated Tests
Test navigation: "go to Google"
Test medical: "biopsy from antrum"
Test general tools: "what's the weather in Surat?"
Verify all return structured responses
Manual Verification
Run voice agent with integrated router
Test all three routing paths via voice
Verify browser opens for navigation
Verify medical JSON extraction
Verify API calls for weather/news
